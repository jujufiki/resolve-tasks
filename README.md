# Resolve Tasks

A minimalist task management app that encourages focused productivity. Tasks automatically move between three folders: "Now" (limited to 5 tasks), "Holding", and "Not Right Now".

## Key Features

- Only shows 5 tasks at a time in the "Now" folder
- Automatically manages task flow between folders
- Tasks can be marked as "Resolved" or "Unresolved"
- Three different modes for pulling new tasks:
  - Category: Matches the category of the completed task
  - Length: Matches the task length
  - Chaos: Random selection

## Philosophy

This app intentionally resets when you refresh the browser. It's designed to help you focus on what's important right now, rather than maintaining a never-ending task list.

## Usage

1. Add tasks with a length (Micro/Short/Medium/Long) and category (Work/Passions/Self/Others)
2. Focus on your "Now" tasks
3. Mark tasks as Resolved when complete
4. Unresolved tasks move to Holding, then to Not Right Now if unresolved twice
5. Refresh the page when you want a completely fresh start
